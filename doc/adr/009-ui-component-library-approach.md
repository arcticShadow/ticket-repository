# 009. UI Component Library and Styling Approach

**Classifications:** ui-components

## Status

Explicitly stated

## Context

The specification states "No need for a polished UI - use an off the shelf component library you are comfortable with." The focus should be on functionality over visual design.

## Decision

Use an off-the-shelf component library for rapid UI development without custom styling or design work.

## Consequences

### Constraints 
- No requirement for custom design or polished appearance
- Should prioritize development speed over visual customization
- Component library should provide basic form inputs, buttons, and layout components
- Minimal custom CSS or styling work needed

### Dependencies
- Affects build configuration and bundle size
- Impacts development workflow and component patterns
- Influences responsive design and accessibility features

### Risk Level
Low - UI polish is explicitly not a priority for this assessment

### Reversibility
Easy - Component libraries can be swapped or enhanced later

### Other Considered Options
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Comprehensive, well-documented, React-focused
- **Ant Design** - Feature-rich, good for admin interfaces
- **Chakra UI** - Simple, modular, good developer experience
- **Bootstrap with React-Bootstrap** - Familiar, lightweight
- **Custom CSS/styling** - Not recommended due to time constraints
