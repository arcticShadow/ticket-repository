# 003. Database Technology Selection

**Classifications:** database

## Status

Explicitly stated

## Context

The application requires persistent storage for events and ticket purchase tracking with strong consistency requirements for concurrency handling. The specification mandates a relational database with PostgreSQL preferred.

## Decision

PostgreSQL. as it is the preferred option.

## Consequences

### Constraints 
- Must be a relational database (ACID compliance required)
- PostgreSQL preferred for production-like behavior
- SQLite acceptable for development simplicity
- MySQL acceptable as alternative RDBMS

### Dependencies
- Affects ORM/query builder selection and database driver choices
- Impacts concurrency handling implementation (transactions, locking)
- Influences deployment and local development setup complexity

### Risk Level
High - Database choice directly impacts concurrency handling requirements

### Reversibility
Moderate - Can switch between relational databases with schema migration effort

### Other Considered Options
- **SQLite** - Simpler setup, file-based, good for development
- **MySQL** - Widely supported, good performance characteristics
- **NoSQL databases** - Not suitable due to ACID transaction requirements
