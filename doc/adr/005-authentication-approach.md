# 005. Authentication and Authorization Approach

**Classifications:** authentication, user-permissions

## Status

Explicitly stated

## Context

The specification explicitly states "No need for authentication - keep it simple" and "No need for role-based access control - assume all users have the same permissions."

## Decision

Implement no authentication or authorization mechanisms. All API endpoints will be publicly accessible and all users have identical permissions.

## Consequences

### Constraints 
- No user identification or session management required
- No protected routes or permission checks needed
- All users can create events and purchase tickets
- Simplified API design without auth headers or tokens

### Dependencies
- Eliminates need for user management database tables
- Removes complexity from frontend state management
- Simplifies API testing and development workflow

### Risk Level
Low - Explicitly defined as acceptable for this assessment scope

### Reversibility
Easy - Authentication can be added later without major architectural changes

### Other Considered Options
- **Simple session-based auth** - Would add unnecessary complexity for assessment
- **JWT token authentication** - Overkill for the specified requirements
- **Basic HTTP authentication** - Not required and adds development overhead
