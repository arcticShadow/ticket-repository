# 010. Deployment and Local Development Strategy

**Classifications:** deployment, development-workflow

## Status

Explicitly stated

## Context

The specification states "No need to deploy this anywhere - running locally is fine." The focus should be on local development setup and ease of running the application.

## Decision

Optimize for local development experience with simple setup instructions. No cloud deployment or production infrastructure required.

## Consequences

### Constraints 
- Must be runnable locally with minimal setup steps
- Should include clear README with setup instructions
- Database can be local (SQLite) or containerized (Docker)
- No need for environment-specific configurations

### Dependencies
- Affects database choice (local vs containerized)
- Impacts build and development tooling decisions
- Influences documentation and setup complexity

### Risk Level
Low - Local development only reduces infrastructure complexity

### Reversibility
Easy - Deployment strategies can be added later without code changes

### Other Considered Options
- **Docker Compose for full stack** - Good for consistency, adds setup complexity
- **Local database files** - Simplest setup, less production-like
- **Cloud deployment** - Not required and adds unnecessary complexity
- **Containerized deployment** - Overkill for assessment scope
