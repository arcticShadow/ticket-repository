# 002. Frontend Technology Stack Selection

**Classifications:** frontend-framework, language

## Status

Explicitly stated

## Context

The application needs a user interface for event management and ticket purchasing. The specification requires React with TypeScript and suggests Next.js as the preferred framework.

## Decision

Use React with TypeScript for the frontend. Next.js is recommended but not required. For simplicity, we will use vanila React, with Vite as the builder/compiler.

## Consequences

### Constraints 
- Must use React as the UI library
- Must implement TypeScript for type safety
- Framework choice (Next.js vs Create React App vs Vite) affects routing and SSR capabilities
- No requirement for polished UI - can use off-the-shelf component libraries

### Dependencies
- Impacts component library selection and styling approach
- Affects build tooling and development server configuration
- Influences state management and API integration patterns

### Risk Level
Medium - Core frontend technology choice that affects entire UI architecture

### Reversibility
Difficult - Changing UI library would require complete frontend rewrite

### Other Considered Options
- **Create React App with TypeScript** - Simpler setup, no SSR capabilities
- **Vite + React + TypeScript** - Faster build times, modern tooling
- **Vue.js or Angular** - Not specified as acceptable alternatives
