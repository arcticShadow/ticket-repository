# 008. Error Handling and Validation Strategy

**Classifications:** error-handling

## Status

Explicitly stated

## Context

The specification states "No complex error handling - just return meaningful errors where necessary." The system needs to handle concurrency conflicts and basic validation errors.

## Decision

Implement minimal but meaningful error handling focusing on concurrency conflicts, validation errors, and resource not found scenarios.

## Consequences

### Constraints 
- Keep error handling simple and straightforward
- Focus on meaningful error messages for user feedback
- Handle critical errors like ticket overselling gracefully
- No need for comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

### Dependencies
- Affects API response format and status code usage
- Impacts frontend error display and user experience
- Influences concurrency handling error scenarios

### Risk Level
Low - Simplified approach acceptable for assessment scope

### Reversibility
Easy - Error handling can be enhanced without major architectural changes

### Other Considered Options
- **Comprehensive error handling framework** - Overkill for assessment requirements
- **Structured error codes and categories** - More complex than needed
- **Minimal error responses only** - May not provide enough user feedback
