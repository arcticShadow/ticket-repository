# 009 Implement Frontend Payment Flow

## Dependencies
- 004: Implement Ticket Purchase with Concurrency Control
- 005: Implement Payment Confirmation Flow
- 008: Implement Frontend Event Detail

## Description
Implement the payment flow interface where users can confirm or cancel their ticket purchase. This interface will make it clear that this is a demo application and no actual payment will be processed, but will allow users to complete the purchase flow.

## Technical Requirements
- Create React components for the payment page
- Implement API integration for ticket purchase and payment confirmation/cancellation
- Display clear messaging about the demo nature of the payment
- Provide "Pay" and "Cancel" buttons with appropriate actions
- Handle success and error states with clear user feedback
- Apply Sakura CSS with dark theme for styling

## Specific test cases required
- Ticket purchase API is called correctly when initiated
- Payment confirmation API is called when "Pay" is clicked
- Payment cancellation API is called when "Cancel" is clicked
- Success and error states are displayed appropriately
- User is redirected to home page after completion
- User device is correctly fingerprinted for ticket allocation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Payment page clearly indicates this is a demo application
- [x] "Pay" button confirms the payment and allocates the ticket
- [x] "Cancel" button cancels the purchase and releases the ticket
- [x] User receives clear feedback about the success or failure of their action
- [x] User is redirected to the home page after completing the flow
- [x] User sees a confirmation message after successful payment
- [x] Tests passing

## Implementation Notes
- Use React Router for navigation and redirects
- Implement client-side fingerprinting to identify the user consistently
- Store fingerprint in localStorage or similar for persistence
- Handle edge cases like network failures during payment confirmation
- Provide clear visual feedback during the payment process
- Consider implementing a simple animation for the payment process
- Use consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

## Documentation Requirements:
