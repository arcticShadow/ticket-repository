# 011 Implement User Fingerprinting

## Dependencies
- 004: Implement Ticket Purchase with Concurrency Control

## Description
Implement a user fingerprinting mechanism to identify users consistently without requiring authentication. This is necessary to track ticket allocations and prevent users from purchasing multiple tickets for the same event.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a client-side fingerprinting solution
- Send fingerprint with ticket purchase and payment requests
- Store fingerprint in the database with ticket allocations
- Ensure the fingerprint is consistent across sessions for the same device
- Balance uniqueness with privacy considerations

## Specific test cases required
- Fingerprint is generated consistently for the same device
- Different devices generate different fingerprints
- Fingerprint persists across page refreshes and browser restarts
- Backend correctly associates tickets with fingerprints
- Backend prevents multiple purchases from the same fingerprint

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Client-side fingerprinting generates a unique identifier for each device
- [x] Fingerprint is included in ticket purchase and payment API requests
- [x] Backend associates ticket allocations with fingerprints
- [x] System prevents multiple ticket purchases for the same event from one fingerprint
- [x] Fingerprint persistence is implemented (localStorage or similar)
- [x] Tests passing

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using a library like FingerprintJS or a simple custom solution
- Balance uniqueness with privacy (avoid overly invasive fingerprinting)
- Store fingerprint in localStorage for persistence
- Include fingerprint in API request headers or request body
- Document the fingerprinting approach and limitations
- Consider edge cases like private browsing or cleared localStorage
- Handle the case where a user tries to purchase from multiple devices
- Provide clear feedback when a user attempts multiple purchases

## Documentation Requirements:
- [x] Document the fingerprinting approach and limitations
- [x] Explain how the system uses fingerprints to track allocations
- [x] Address privacy considerations in documentation
