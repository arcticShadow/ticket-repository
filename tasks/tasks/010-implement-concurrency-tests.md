# 010 Implement Concurrency Tests

## Dependencies
- 004: Implement Ticket Purchase with Concurrency Control
- 005: Implement Payment Confirmation Flow
- ADR-011: Testing Strategy and Scope

## Description
Implement BATS (Bash Automated Testing System) tests to validate the concurrency handling of the ticket purchasing system. These tests will ensure that the system prevents overselling even under high concurrent load.

## Technical Requirements
- Create BATS test scripts for concurrency testing
- Implement tests that simulate multiple concurrent ticket purchases
- Validate that no more tickets are sold than are available
- Test edge cases like exactly at capacity and just over capacity
- Implement test cleanup to reset the database between test runs

## Specific test cases required
- Multiple concurrent purchases for an event with limited tickets
- Exactly the right number of purchases succeed
- Additional purchases fail with appropriate error messages
- Database state is consistent after concurrent operations
- Ticket allocations are correctly tracked

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] BATS tests verify that concurrent ticket purchases do not result in overselling
- [x] Tests confirm that exactly the right number of tickets are allocated
- [x] Tests validate appropriate error responses for sold-out events
- [x] Tests check database state consistency after concurrent operations
- [x] Test script is runnable from the command line
- [x] Tests consistently pass, demonstrating the concurrency control works
- [x] Tests passing

## Implementation Notes
- Follow the example from ADR-011 for BATS test structure
- Use curl for API calls and jq for JSON parsing
- Implement proper test setup and teardown
- Create test data with known constraints (e.g., events with exactly 10 tickets)
- Use bash constructs to launch concurrent API calls
- Validate both API responses and database state
- Consider varying the concurrency level to test different scenarios
- Document how to run the tests and interpret results

## Documentation Requirements:
- [x] Document how to run the concurrency tests
- [x] Explain the expected results and how to interpret them
- [x] Update README.md with testing information
