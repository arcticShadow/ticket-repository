# 008 Implement Frontend Event Detail

## Dependencies

- 003: Implement Event Management API
- 006: Implement Real-time Event Statistics
- 007: Implement Frontend Event Listing

## Description

Implement the event detail page where users can view detailed information about a specific event, including real-time statistics (remaining tickets, allocated tickets, and purchased tickets) from the SSE stream. This page will also provide the entry point to the ticket purchase flow.

## Technical Requirements

- Create SIMPLE React components for the event detail page
- Implement API integration to fetch event details
- Connect to the SSE stream for real-time statistics
- Display ticket availability information in real-time
- Provide a "Buy Ticket" button to initiate the purchase flow
- Apply Sakura CSS with dark theme for styling

## Specific test cases required

- Event details are fetched and displayed correctly
- SSE connection is established and updates are shown in real-time
- "Buy Ticket" button is disabled when no tickets are available
- UI updates immediately when statistics change
- Error states (e.g., API failure, SSE connection issues) are handled gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Event detail page displays comprehensive information about the selected event
- [x] Real-time statistics show remaining tickets, allocated tickets, and purchased tickets
- [x] Statistics update in real-time when changes occur
- [x] "Buy Ticket" button initiates the ticket purchase flow
- [x] Button is disabled when no tickets are available
- [x] Page has proper loading, error, and connection state handling
- [x] Tests passing

## Implementation Notes

- Use EventSource API to connect to the SSE stream
- Implement proper cleanup of SSE connection when component unmounts
- Handle reconnection in case of connection issues
- Use React context or state management for sharing event data
- Consider using animation or visual cues when statistics change
- Implement proper error handling for both API and SSE connection failures
- Design the page to be responsive for different screen sizes
- Use React Router for navigation to the payment page

## Documentation Requirements:

- [x] Document SSE integration approach
- [x] Update component documentation
